# Hindi-Character-Recognition
This is a Character Recognition System to recognize Devanagari Script. The learning model was trained on 70 thousand images (32x32 pixels) of 64 characters, digits 0 to 9. The optimal result of 97.2% accuracy was achieved.This code helps classify different alphabets of hindi language (Devanagiri) using CNN.


# Convolutional Neural Networks
 A convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.
